# Heart-Attack-Prediction

## Abstract
The project was prepared and submitted by C. Pinheiro, E. Carvalho, M. Nazarkovsky, G. Piovesan, I. Barros within the Brazilian "Bootcamp Data Science na pr√°tica" by Neuron (https://www.facebook.com/neuronDSAI/photos/a.1924971354499031/2664668797195946/?type=3&amp;eid=ARCBaznRnMGbE-iFheLbf7HyZpHcxpz7vT-F8J9Yl9_BrqHtwnjLsmdbyaE4l4nbEJKXWdg2aLyGuj7B&amp;ifg=1).

The dataset was provided by the Bootcamp administration from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/imnikhilanand/heart-attack-prediction

## Methods

In order to perform the typical classification procedure for the binary output, following metrics are required to select the optimal model: misclassification rate, F1, Accuracy. The project is supported by figures found in the Issues section. 

The data were stratified and divided : 75% for training, 25% for validation (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63872579/107993039-c71a7e80-6fb8-11eb-92b9-fb462a3de265.jpg).

The models for machine learning: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (155 Neighbors estimated through euclidean distances at the uniform weights of points), Multiple Logistic Regression, SVM (linear kernel function, cost = 1), Boosted Tree and Bootstrap Forest.
